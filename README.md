Implementation of Dijkstras algorithm with visuals.
Dijkstras algorithm uses a bfs search to find the least weighted path between two nodes in a graph.
This programs assumes a undirected graph.

The Dijkstra class contains an implementation of djikstras algorithm and uses paintComponent to visualize the algorithm. The Node and Connection classes are used as data structures.
